        <h1> Education </h1>
        <p>
            I previously went to Midland University in Fremont, Nebraska. <br>
            While I was there, I swam competitively on their team and graduated with a bachelors in Business
            Intelligence and Technology (BIT) after 2 years. <br>
            I am currently a student at UNO in their MIS graduate program and am in my first year. <br>
            The was able to graduate with a bachelors in 2 years because of the amount of college credits I received
            while in high school.
