        <h1> Hobbies </h1>
        <p>
            Some of my favorite hobbies include playing video games, watching tv, and skateboarding. <br>
            Recently, I've been collecting old video game systems and games that I used to play when I was a kid. <br>
            I like to go to different thrift stores for old games and collect any cool games that I can find. <br>
            I enjoy skateboarding but I'm not very good at it and take frequent breaks from it because I'm afraid of
            getting hurt. <br>
            Hopefully I will be able to pick it back up more seriously after I finish swimming competitively.
